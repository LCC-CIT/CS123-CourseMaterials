    <h1>Bayes Classifier: Likelihood Ratio</h1>
    
    <h2>Detailed Explanation:</h2>
    <p>The likelihood ratio is the part of Bayes' Rule that incorporates new information or evidence. It's a way to measure how much a new piece of evidence (like a specific word in an email) changes the odds in favor of one hypothesis over another. The likelihood ratio is calculated by comparing the probability of seeing the evidence given one hypothesis (e.g., the word "Viagra" appearing in a spam email) to the probability of seeing the same evidence given the alternative hypothesis (e.g., the word "Viagra" appearing in a non-spam email). A likelihood ratio greater than 1 increases the odds of a hypothesis, while a ratio less than 1 decreases it. It's the "new clue" that helps you update your initial belief.</p>

    <h2>Comprehension Question:</h2>
    <p>How does a likelihood ratio of 5 affect the prior odds of a hypothesis?</p>

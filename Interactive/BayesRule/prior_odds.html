    <h1>Bayes Classifier: Prior Odds</h1>
    
    <h2>Detailed Explanation:</h2>
    <p>Prior odds represent your initial assessment or belief about a hypothesis <em>before</em> any new evidence is considered. They are a starting point for the classification process. You calculate prior odds based on historical data or past observations. For example, if you are building a spam filter and you know from your old emails that about 80% are not spam and 20% are spam, your prior odds for a new email being "not spam" would be 80:20, or 4:1. These prior odds are crucial because they ground the classifier's decisions in a realistic understanding of the world. They give the system a baseline to work from before it even looks at the content of a new email.</p>

    <p>Why are prior odds considered a "starting point" for a Bayes classifier?</p>

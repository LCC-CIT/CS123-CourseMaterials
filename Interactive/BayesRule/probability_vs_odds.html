    <h1>Bayes Classifier: Probability vs. Odds</h1>
    
    <h2>Detailed Explanation:</h2>
    <p>In everyday language, "probability" and "odds" are often used interchangeably, but in mathematics and statistics, they have distinct meanings.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Probability</strong> is a way of expressing the chance of something happening as a fraction or a percentage. It is calculated by dividing the number of successful outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. For example, the probability of flipping a coin and getting heads is 1/2 or 50%. The value of a probability always falls between 0 and 1 (or 0% and 100%).</li>
        <li><strong>Odds</strong> are a ratio that compares the number of successful outcomes to the number of unsuccessful outcomes. For the same coin flip, the odds of getting heads are 1:1 (one successful outcome for every one unsuccessful outcome). Unlike probability, odds can be any positive number. The key difference is the denominator: probability uses the total number of outcomes, while odds use the number of <em>other</em> outcomes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Comprehension Question:</h2>
    <p>If the probability of it raining tomorrow is 2/5, what are the odds of it raining?</p>

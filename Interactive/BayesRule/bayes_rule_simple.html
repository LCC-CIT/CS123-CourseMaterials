    <h1>Bayes Classifier: Bayes' Rule (Simpler Explanation)</h1>
    
    <p>Bayes' Rule is a special recipe for making predictions. You start with what you already know (your first guess or "prior belief"). Then, when you get a new clue (the "likelihood"), you use this rule to combine your old guess with the new clue. The result is a much better, smarter guess (the "posterior belief"). It's like a detective who gets a new piece of evidence and uses it to update their theory about a case.</p>

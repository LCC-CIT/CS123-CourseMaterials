<h1>CS 123: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence</h1>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

[TOC]

# Introduction

Welcome to this class! 

Since the release of ChatGPT in November of 2022, AI has become an even hotter topic than it already was. AI already had a big presence in our lives, but now it seems to have exploded in a way that has taken many of us by surprise.

AI has great potential for good as well as evil. Some people are excited to see it advance, others are cautious and others see it as a doomsday technology. Regardless of your viewpoint, AI will play a big role our future, so it is important to have some understanding of how it works and how we can use it for good while guarding against ways in which it might be abused.

## Time commitment

Since this class has been compressed from ten-and-a-half weeks to eight weeks for the summer term, you will need to put in a little more time each week than you would in a "normal" class. In order to be successful, you should set aside at least <u>10 hours a week</u> for learning activities. This includes 4 hours in class, participating in the Zoom live-stream, or watching recordings of the lectures; plus at least 6 hours studying on your own. 

I hope the effort is all worth it and you *learn to do good (maybe even exciting) things with AI!*

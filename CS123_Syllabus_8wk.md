# Course Description

This course provides an overview of the field of Artificial Intelligence. Students will learn what AI is and how machine learning works. There will be a focus on generative AI and its practical applications in the workplace such as prompt engineering and creating custom GPT chatbots. The risks and dangers of AI will be explored along with the potential benefits.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

1. Explain what AI is.
2. Discuss the potential dangers and benefits of AI to society.
3. Describe how neural networks are used in deep machine learning.
4. Decide what uses of AI are appropriate in education and work settings.

<u>Exercises</u>
Weekly (except midterm an final quiz weeks) exercises give you practice with concepts learned during each week.

<u>Quizzes</u>
Weekly (except midterm an final quiz weeks) quizzes are given that cover learning material for that week. These quizzes are "open book".

<u>Team Projects</u>
You will work together with your team to either make a presentation or create an AI solution. Each team member will have a specific part to contribute and will be individually graded.

<u>Midterm and Final Quizzes</u>

The midterm and final quizzes are given in weeks 4 and 8. See Moodle for exact dates and times. Quizzes are "closed book", but students may prepare a 8 1/2 x 11 sheet of notes to refer to during the quiz. These quizzes may be taken either:

- On-campus students (hybrid modality) will take the quiz In the classroom during the normal class time.

- online students will take the quiz In the Instructional Testing Center in the Center Building, room 311. See the [Instructional Testing Services](https://www.lanecc.edu/get-support/academic-support/instructional-testing-services) web site for testing times and procedures.  

  Students who live outside the Eugene/Springfield area can send an email to [online@lanecc.edu](mailto:online@lanecc.edu) well in advance of the test dates to arrange for your midterm and final to be proctored at a location near you.

## Academic Honesty

While students are encouraged to discuss assignments and to use each other as resources, each student is responsible for his/her own work. In other words you can help each other, but you can’t copy any part of someone else’s work. The end product must be each student’s own individual work.

### Use of AI

Generative AI tools such as GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT are useful resources and you are encouraged to use them, but don't use them to give you quiz answers or do your assignments for you. Use them to help you learn, to come up with ideas, or for drafts of text you write.

## Participation and Attendance

While participation and attendance are essential to succeed in this class, they will not be graded.

### No Show Drop

The college’s “no show, drop” policy requires that: during the first week students must complete at least one activity (a quiz or assignment) otherwise the student will be dropped from the class.

## Late Work

- Grades for assignments submitted after the due date will be reduced by 10%.
- No late assignments accepted after Friday of week 8 (the last week of summer term).
- Quizzes and exams cannot be taken after the due date. 
  Plan ahead! Exceptions will only be made for illness or emergency situations.

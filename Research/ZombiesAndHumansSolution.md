# The Problem

River crossing problem:
Three humans and three zombies are on one side of a river. They all need to get to the other side. There is one rowboat.

- The boat can only carry two of them for each crossing.
- At least one of them has to be in the boat to row it.
- Only the boat can be used to cross the river (no wading or swimming).
- If the zombies on either side of the river outnumber the humans, they will kill them.



# The Solution

### State Representation:

Each state can be represented as a tuple (H,Z,B)(H, Z, B)(H,Z,B), where:

- HHH is the number of humans on the starting bank.
- ZZZ is the number of zombies on the starting bank.
- BBB indicates the position of the boat (0 for starting bank, 1 for the other bank).

### Initial State

(3,3,0)(3, 3, 0)(3,3,0)

### Goal State

(0,0,1)(0, 0, 1)(0,0,1)

### State Transitions

Possible transitions are based on moving 1 or 2 people across the river. Here are the legal transitions:

1. (H−1,Z,B)(H-1, Z, B)(H−1,Z,B) → (H−1,Z,1−B)(H-1, Z, 1-B)(H−1,Z,1−B) if one human crosses.
2. (H−2,Z,B)(H-2, Z, B)(H−2,Z,B) → (H−2,Z,1−B)(H-2, Z, 1-B)(H−2,Z,1−B) if two humans cross.
3. (H,Z−1,B)(H, Z-1, B)(H,Z−1,B) → (H,Z−1,1−B)(H, Z-1, 1-B)(H,Z−1,1−B) if one zomby crosses.
4. (H,Z−2,B)(H, Z-2, B)(H,Z−2,B) → (H,Z−2,1−B)(H, Z-2, 1-B)(H,Z−2,1−B) if two zombies cross.
5. (H−1,Z−1,B)(H-1, Z-1, B)(H−1,Z−1,B) → (H−1,Z−1,1−B)(H-1, Z-1, 1-B)(H−1,Z−1,1−B) if one human and one zomby cross.

All transitions must respect the constraints: at no point should humans be outnumbered by zombies on either bank.

### Solution Path

We can use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. Here is a step-by-step solution:

1. Initial state: (3,3,0)(3, 3, 0)(3,3,0)
2. Move two zombies: (3,1,1)(3, 1, 1)(3,1,1)
3. Move one zomby back: (3,2,0)(3, 2, 0)(3,2,0)
4. Move two zombies: (3,0,1)(3, 0, 1)(3,0,1)
5. Move one zomby back: (3,1,0)(3, 1, 0)(3,1,0)
6. Move two humans: (1,1,1)(1, 1, 1)(1,1,1)
7. Move one zomby and one human back: (2,2,0)(2, 2, 0)(2,2,0)
8. Move two humans: (0,2,1)(0, 2, 1)(0,2,1)
9. Move one zomby back: (0,3,0)(0, 3, 0)(0,3,0)
10. Move two zombies: (0,1,1)(0, 1, 1)(0,1,1)
11. Move one zomby back: (0,2,0)(0, 2, 0)(0,2,0)
12. Move two zombies: (0,0,1)(0, 0, 1)(0,0,1)

### State Space and Transitions

```
plaintextCopy code(3, 3, 0)
 -> (3, 1, 1)
 -> (3, 2, 0)
 -> (3, 0, 1)
 -> (3, 1, 0)
 -> (1, 1, 1)
 -> (2, 2, 0)
 -> (0, 2, 1)
 -> (0, 3, 0)
 -> (0, 1, 1)
 -> (0, 2, 0)
 -> (0, 0, 1)
```

### Explanation of Steps

1. **Initial state:** All humans and zombies are on the starting bank.
2. **Move two zombies:** Reduces risk of outnumbering on the other bank.
3. **Move one zomby back:** Ensures boat returns without imbalance.
4. **Move two zombies:** Ensures safety and moves towards the goal.
5. **Move one zomby back:** Prepares boat for next safe crossing.
6. **Move two humans:** Starts balancing out humans.
7. **Move one zomby and one human back:** Balances both banks.
8. **Move two humans:** Nears completion by safely moving humans.
9. **Move one zomby back:** Prepares final safe moves.
10. **Move two zombies:** Moves towards goal with balance.
11. **Move one zomby back:** Ensures safe final state.
12. **Move two zombies:** Reaches the goal state with everyone safe.

This step-by-step method ensures that at no point are the humans outnumbered by the zombies on either bank, thus solving the problem.

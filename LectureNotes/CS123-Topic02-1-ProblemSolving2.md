# Introduction

## What's Happening

All activities are due Sunday night, 10/13/24

- Exercises for Ch. 2, "Problem Solving" in *Elements of AI*
- Lecture Q and A forum for online students
- Lecture quiz for everyone.

Next week the first project will be due.

# Problem Solving

This is based on Ch. 2 of *Elements of AI*

## Search and Problem Solving

Many problems can be thought of as search problems. We normally think of searching as a way to solve problems like finding a web site, finding a book in a library, or finding a product in an online store. But search can also be used to find the shortest route on a road map or the best sequence of moves to win a game.

The kinds of problems we solve with AI can be classified according to the problem's *environment[^1]* One way of classifying environments is by number of *agents*[^2]

Two types of search problems (there are more than two) are:

- Problems with only one agent&mdash;a route finding problem is an example.
- Problems with two agents&mdash;a two-player game is an example.

### Single-Agent Problems

Just one agent (would be person if it wasn't AI) is making decisions.

**River Crossing Problems**

If you search the internet you will find a lot of different logic puzzles involving getting things (or people, animals or other entities) across a river. These are examples of *single agent* problems since there is only one agent (you, the problem solver) directing the action. 

They are search problems since you search the *state-space*[^3] to find the minimum number of *transitions*[^4] between states that will solve the problem.

- Ch.2 of *Elements of AI* describes the "Chicken, feed, and fox" problem.
- Look at a solution to  the [Zombies and humans river crossing problem](https://lcc-cit.github.io/CS123-CourseMaterials/LectureNotes/Topic-01-4-ZombieCrossingSolution.html).

### Two-Agent Problems

Two agents are making decisions. It could be two AI systems or an AI system and a human.

**Game Playing Problems**

Two-player games are examples of *two-agent* problems.

- Ch. 2 of Elements of AI describes making a game tree for tic-tac toe that can be searched using the *minimax algorithm*[^5] in order to find winning moves.
- These [notes from the Australian National University](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/pages/2021-S1/courses/comp1100/lectures/09-2-Game_Trees.pdf) describe making a game tree for the game of nim, assigning values to nodes, and searching the tree for winning moves.

**Real World Problems**

- Autonomous Vehicles: In scenarios where two drivers of two vehicles need to interact, such as at an intersection or during lane changes.
- Customer Service: AI chatbots can interact with human customers to resolve issues, answer questions, and provide support.
- Collaborative Robotics: In manufacturing or warehouse settings, AI-powered robots can work alongside human workers or other robots to complete tasks.

#### Game/Search Trees

[See the tictactoe search tree in Elements of AI, Ch. 2](https://course.elementsofai.com/2/3)

#### MiniMax Algorithm

he minimax algorithm is a recursive (repetative) decision-making algorithm used in two-player zero-sum games, where one player’s gain is the other player’s loss. The goal is to <u>min</u>imize the <u>max</u>imum possible loss for a worst-case scenario (hence “minimax”).

#### Steps of the Minimax Algorithm:

1. **Generate the Game Tree**: Create a tree of all possible moves from the current state to the terminal states (end of the game).
2. **Evaluate Terminal States**: Assign a value to each terminal state based on the outcome:
   - Positive value for a win.
   - Negative value for a loss.
   - Zero for a draw.
3. **Backpropagate Values**:  
   Starting from the terminal nodes, the algorithm moves up the tree, level by level, to the root. At each level, it applies the minimax decision rule:
   - **Maximizing Player’s Turn**: Choose the value from the move with the highest value from the child nodes.
   - **Minimizing Player’s Turn**: Choose the value from the move with the lowest value from the child nodes.

[^1]: The *environment* of the problem is made up of the things in the world that surrounds the problem.
[^2]: An *agent* is someone or something that is directing the actions.
[^3]: State-space
[^4]: A *transition* is the change from one state to another within the state-space.
[^5]: The *minimax algorithm* is used to search a tree (a type of computer data structure) to find paths through branches with either minim or maximum values.

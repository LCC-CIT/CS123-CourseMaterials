    [Example video presentation](https://share.synthesia.io/b01113e0-46da-4674-80c0-9e32f183a8f2)





## Ethical issues:

- [Deep fakes](https://youtu.be/pkF3m5wVUYI?si=-2bWjBdmlDLDL7Y8)

- "Cheating". Using something created by AI and saying it was your own creation. As with anything, you should cite your source and attribute it.

  - Examples of attribution, an image:

    <img src="Images\CartoonDuckTyping.jpeg" alt="CartoonDuckTyping" style="zoom:33%;" />

    *Image made by Brian Bird using Dall-E 3*

  - A poem:
    A duck with a quack, typed stories, never looked back. 
    With webbed feet on keys, He wrote with ease.

    *Poem made by Brian Bird using GPT-4*




- Making a machine appear to be a person.
- A lot of the same issues as with training:
  - Energy use
  - Privacy
  - Bias

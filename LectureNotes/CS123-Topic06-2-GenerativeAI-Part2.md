### Using Generative AI at Work

Generative AI is already being used in many fields. Here are some specific real-world applications:

1. **Content Creation:**
   - **Text Generation:** Tools like GPT-3 can generate human-like text for writing articles, summarizing content, creating chatbots, and even composing poetry or stories.
   - **Image Synthesis:** GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) can create realistic images, which are used in areas such as game development, movie special effects, and advertising.
2. **Healthcare:**
   - **Drug Discovery:** Generative AI helps in designing new molecules for pharmaceuticals, speeding up the process of drug discovery.
   - **Medical Imaging:** AI can generate detailed medical images for diagnostic purposes, enhancing the accuracy of medical assessments.
3. **Fashion and Design:**
   - **Clothing Design:** AI can generate new fashion designs, from clothes to accessories, and even help with pattern-making and fabric selection.
   - **Interior Design:** Tools that generate 3D models and room layouts based on user preferences are becoming increasingly popular.
4. **Music and Art:**
   - **Music Composition:** AI can compose music in various genres, aiding musicians in creating new pieces or generating background scores for videos and games.
   - **Art Creation:** AI-generated artwork is now being featured in galleries and auctions, pushing the boundaries of creativity.
5. **Virtual Environments:**
   - **Video Game Development:** AI can create expansive, realistic virtual worlds and characters, enhancing the gaming experience.
   - **Virtual Reality (VR):** Generative AI is used to create immersive VR experiences for education, training, and entertainment.
6. **Finance:**
   - **Algorithmic Trading:** AI can generate trading strategies and execute trades automatically, optimizing investment portfolios.
   - **Fraud Detection:** Generative models can identify patterns and anomalies, helping to detect and prevent fraudulent activities.
7. **Marketing:**
   - **Personalized Advertising:** AI generates personalized ad content based on user data, improving engagement and conversion rates.
   - **Customer Insights:** Analyzing consumer behavior to create targeted marketing campaigns.



## Ethical issues:

- [Deep fakes](https://youtu.be/pkF3m5wVUYI?si=-2bWjBdmlDLDL7Y8)

- "Cheating". Using something created by AI and saying it was your own creation. As with anything, you should cite your source and attribute it.

  - Examples of attribution, an image:

    <img src="Images\CartoonDuckTyping.jpeg" alt="CartoonDuckTyping" style="zoom:33%;" />

    *Image made by Brian Bird using Dall-E 3*

  - A poem:
    A duck with a quack, typed stories, never looked back. 
    With webbed feet on keys, He wrote with ease.

    *Poem made by Brian Bird using GPT-4*




- Making a machine appear to be a person.
- A lot of the same issues as with training:
  - Energy use
  - Privacy
  - Bias

<h1>How Does Generative AI Work?</h1>



# Definition of AI

**Artificial intelligence (AI)**,  the ability of a digital [computer](https://www.britannica.com/technology/computer) or computer-controlled [robot](https://www.britannica.com/technology/robot-technology) to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. &mdash;[Brittanica.com](https://www.britannica.com/technology/artificial-intelligence)

# Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that gives  computers the ability to learn without explicitly being programmed. &mdash;[MIT Sloan School of Management](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/machine-learning-explained)

Machine learning is one way to use AI. It was defined in the 1950s by AI pioneer [Arthur Samuel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Samuel) as “the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without explicitly being programmed.”

Machine learning is a branch of [artificial intelligence (AI)](https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to  imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy. &mdash;[IBM](https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning)

Traditional programming similarly requires creating detailed instructions for the computer to follow.

But in some cases, writing a program for the machine to follow is  time-consuming or impossible, such as training a computer to recognize  pictures of different people. While humans can do this task easily, it’s difficult to tell a computer how to do it. Machine learning takes the  approach of letting computers learn to program themselves through  experience. 

Machine learning starts with data — numbers, photos, or text, like bank transactions, pictures of people or even [bakery items](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/the-pastry-ai-that-learned-to-fight-cancer), repair records, time series data from sensors, or sales reports. The  data is gathered and prepared to be used as training data, or the  information the machine learning model will be trained on. The more  data, the better the program.

machine learning is best suited for situations with lots of data — thousands or millions of examples, 

From there, programmers choose a machine learning model to use, supply  the data, and let the computer model train itself to find patterns or  make predictions. 

Some data is held out from the training data to be used as evaluation  data, which tests how accurate the machine learning model is when it is  shown new data. The result is a model that can be used in the future  with different sets of data.

**Supervised** machine learning models are trained with  labeled data sets, which allow the models to learn and grow more  accurate over time. For example, an algorithm would be trained with  pictures of dogs and other things, all labeled by humans, and the  machine would learn ways to identify pictures of dogs on its own.  Supervised machine learning is the most common type used today.

In **unsupervised** machine learning, a program looks for  patterns in unlabeled data. Unsupervised machine learning can find  patterns or trends that people aren’t explicitly looking for. For  example, an unsupervised machine learning program could look through  online sales data and identify different types of clients making  purchases.

**Reinforcement** machine learning trains machines through  trial and error to take the best action by establishing a reward system. Reinforcement learning can train models to play games or train  autonomous vehicles to drive by telling the machine when it made the  right decisions, which helps it learn over time what actions it should  take.

**Neural networks**

[Neural networks](https://news.mit.edu/2017/explained-neural-networks-deep-learning-0414) are a commonly used, specific class of machine learning algorithms.  Artificial neural networks are modeled on the human brain, in which  thousands or millions of processing nodes are interconnected and  organized into layers.

In an artificial neural network, cells, or nodes, are connected, with each cell processing inputs and producing an output that is sent to  other neurons. Labeled data moves through the nodes, or cells, with each cell performing a different function. In a neural network trained to  identify whether a picture contains a cat or not, the different nodes  would assess the information and arrive at an output that indicates  whether a picture features a cat.

**Deep learning**

Deep learning networks are neural networks with many layers. The  layered network can process extensive amounts of data and determine the  “weight” of each link in the network — for example, in an image  recognition system, some layers of the neural network might detect  individual features of a face, like eyes, nose, or mouth, while another  layer would be able to tell whether those features appear in a way that  indicates a face. 

**Explainability** 

One area of concern is what some experts call explainability, or the  ability to be clear about what the machine learning models are doing and how they make decisions. “Understanding why a model does what it does  is actually a very difficult question, and you always have to ask  yourself that,” Madry said. “You should never treat this as a black box, that just comes as an oracle … yes, you should use it, but then try to  get a feeling of what are the rules of thumb that it came up with? And  then validate them.”

### Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning vs. Neural Networks                            

Machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks are all sub-fields  of artificial intelligence. However, neural networks is actually a  sub-field of machine learning, and deep learning is a sub-field of  neural networks.

The way in which deep learning and machine learning differ is in how  each algorithm learns. "Deep" machine learning can use labeled datasets, also known as supervised learning, to inform its algorithm, but it  doesn’t necessarily require a labeled dataset. Deep learning can ingest  unstructured data in its raw form (e.g., text or images), and it can  automatically determine the set of features which distinguish different  categories of data from one another. 

### Neural Networks

Neural networks, or artificial neural networks (ANNs), are comprised of  node layers, containing an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and  an output layer. Each node, or artificial neuron, connects to another  and has an associated weight and threshold. If the output of any  individual node is above the specified threshold value, that node is  activated, sending data to the next layer of the network. Otherwise, no  data is passed along to the next layer of the network by that node. The  “deep” in deep learning is just referring to the number of layers in a  neural network. A neural network that consists of more than three  layers—which would be inclusive of the input and the output—can be  considered a deep learning algorithm or a deep neural network. A neural  network that only has three layers is just a basic neural network.



# Foundation Models

A foundation model is an **AI model** that is trained on  broad data such that it can be applied across a wide range of use cases. Foundation models have transformed AI, powering prominent chatbots and  generative AI. &mdash;[Wikipedia](https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=9e41a1551d938281JmltdHM9MTcwNjIyNzIwMCZpZ3VpZD0wOTVlNDgyZC00MzA5LTY4ZWYtMzQwNy01OGNlNDJhMTY5NWQmaW5zaWQ9NTQ3Nw&ptn=3&ver=2&hsh=3&fclid=095e482d-4309-68ef-3407-58ce42a1695d&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly9lbi53aWtpcGVkaWEub3JnL3dpa2kvRm91bmRhdGlvbl9tb2RlbCM6fjp0ZXh0PUElMjBmb3VuZGF0aW9uJTIwbW9kZWwlMjBpcyUyMGFuJTIwQUklMjBtb2RlbCUyMHRoYXQsQUklMkMlMjBwb3dlcmluZyUyMHByb21pbmVudCUyMGNoYXRib3RzJTIwYW5kJTIwZ2VuZXJhdGl2ZSUyMEFJLiUyMA&ntb=1)

### AI Problems

- Lost jobs
- Invasion of privacy (by governments and corporations)
- Violation of copyrights, no attribution or remuneration to authors or artists
- Hindering education (students short-circuit their learning)
- Diminished sense of what it means to be human (machines that appear to be persons could lead to persons being regarded as machines)
- <mark>Environmental damage due to use of power and water by data centers</mark>
- Bias in training and inequitable access
- Spreading false information, deep fakes
- Used for phishing and cyberattacks
- Military and police abuse
- Humans loosing control of AI

## The Power Problem

### Power Used by Data Centers

- Power used by all data centers in 2024: 183 terawatt-hours (TWh) 
  - natural gas supplied over 40% of electricity for U.S. data centers, [according to the IEA](https://www.iea.org/reports/energy-and-ai/energy-supply-for-ai). Renewables such as wind and solar supplied about 24% of electricity at  data centers, while nuclear power supplied around 20% and coal around  15%.

- Projected power use by 2030: 426 TWh
  - An increase of 133%
- US Power generation capacity: 1.3 TW
  - How does this translate to max power consumption?

### Nucular Power

The emissions from individual AI text, image, and video queries seem small—until you add up what the industry isn’t tracking and consider where it’s heading next.

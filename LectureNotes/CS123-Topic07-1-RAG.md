## What is RAG?

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is an advanced AI technique that enhances the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by integrating an information retrieval system. This system fetches relevant information from external sources, which the LLM then uses to generate more accurate and reliable responses¹²³.

## Why Use it?

- **Improved Accuracy**: By grounding the model on external sources of knowledge, RAG helps in providing more accurate and up-to-date information³.
- **Cost-Effective**: It allows organizations to improve LLM outputs without the need for expensive retraining¹.
- **Enhanced Control**: Organizations can control the data sources used by the LLM, ensuring that the generated responses are relevant and authoritative².

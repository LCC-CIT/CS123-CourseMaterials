# Key Events in the History of AI

## Turing

1950: Alan Turing released “Computing Machinery and Intelligence,” questioning whether or not machines could manifest human intelligence and proposed the "imitation game", aka the Turing test.



1952: [Arthur Samuel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Samuel_(computer_scientist)) created a checkers-playing computer program that could determine the probability of winning a game. It was the first program to <u>learn</u> how to <u>autonomously</u> play a game.

## Copilot Studio

Full details on creating a custom GPT chatbot are provided in the [Microsoft documentation for Copilot Studio](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/microsoft-copilot-studio).

There are essentially two ways a chatbot created in Copilot Studio can generate answers:

- **Topics**: This approach is based on using keywords in the user's query to trigger topics that have branching conversation flows that follow a decision tree (remember this from symbolic logic?)

- **Generative**: An LLM is used with RAG to generate responses to the user's queries.

## Tips

### Generative AI Responses

- To get your copilot to use generative AI to respond, go to Settings, Generative AI, and click the radio button labeled "Generative (preview)" 

- In order to get the copilot to use my web site, in "Overview" I had to turn off "Allow the AI to use its own general knowledge (preview)".

### Greeting

The initial greeting comes from the topic: "conversation start". You can edit it in "conversation flow".

### Authentication

Click on the "Settings" button, "Security", "Authentication". These are the options

- No authentication: *This is the reccomended option for our class assignment.*

- Authenticate with Microsoft

  If you want to use OneDrive as a knowledge source, you have to use this option, which uses *Microsoft Entra ID*[^1],  but, then you won't be able to publish to a web site!
  
- Authenticate manually

### Knowledge Sources

Click on the  "Add Knowledge" button, there will be two options, choose "Featured". The sources shown here are sources that don *not* require a special *enterprise data connection*:

- Public web sites (must be indexed by Bing)  
  - You can see if the site you want to use is indexed by Bing by using the `site:` search operator. For example, in the Bing search bar type:
     `site:yourdomain.com`
    This will show all the pages from your site that have been indexed.
- Files
- OneDrive folders&mdash;Requires Microsoft Entra ID (Teams and Office 365)



#### Index for Searching

All knowledge source depend on the source for searching. This means the files need to have their content indexed. It happens different ways in different knowledge sources:

- Web site: your site needs to be indexed by Bing. This can take days (or more) and depends on getting your site ready according to the [Bing Webmaster](https://www.bing.com/webmasters) requirements.
- Files: will be made searchable by Dataverse.
- OneDrive: Will be indexed by OneDrive almost immediately after upload.

#### Document Types for Files

- Markdown and html  
  These files could be in one of three knowledge sources: web site, files, or OneDrive.
  - In a web site: just html will be indexed, citations (links in the response) open as a web page. 
  - In files: (stored in Dataverse) both will be indexed, citations open as text only.
  - In OneDrive: neither will be indexed
  
- PDF and Word
  - PDFs and Word docs get indexed everywhere
  - PDF citations open as documents, Word docs get downloaded instead of opening
  
- Excel and .csv
  - Both can be searched and understood when uploaded as files.

Bot said: Understood. Your copilot will maintain a positive, encouraging,  and helpful tone. It will not complete students’ lab assignments or  provide answers to quiz questions. Where should the copilot find important information? Provide any  publicly accessible websites that your copilot will need.

Bot said: Thank you for the detailed sources. Your copilot will retrieve  information from the syllabus and gettingStarted_Book for class policy,  LectureNotes for HTML and CSS topics, and Labs directory for lab  assignments. Are there any topics or tasks this copilot shouldn’t help with or talk  about?

# Overview

Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining inputs (prompts) to generative AI systems to improve the accuracy and quality of the generated output.

# Components of a Good Prompt

A good prompt for AI is most effective if it has:

1. **Clarity**: The prompt should be clear, specific and unambiguous, making it easy for the AI to understand what is being asked.
   - **Example**: Instead of asking “Tell me about AI,” you can ask “Give me a summary of the latest advances in AI.”

2. **Relevance**: use relevant keywords or phrases. This helps the AI understand your intent and deliver relevant results.
   - **Example**: Instead of asking: “Tell me about cloud computing”, you can ask  “I’m researching cloud computing trends in the IT industry. Provide recent reports and articles on the topic.”
   
3. **Conciseness**: A prompt should be as brief as possible while still conveying all necessary information.

4. **Context**: Providing relevant context helps the AI understand the background of the thing you're asking for. 

   - **Example**: “Given the recent advancements in AI, what are the potential ethical concerns?”

   - **Result**: The AI considers the context of recent advancements and addresses relevant ethical concerns.

5. **Provide Clear Instructions**: Clear instructions on what is expected from the AI can guide it to produce the desired output.

# Prompting Best Practices

1. ​              

# More Prompting Strategies

####  Data Organization Prompts

- Definition: These prompts ask the model to organize data in a specific format.
- Example: "Create a table with the top 5 highest-grossing movies, their release years, and box office earnings."

Try this one using Gemini and export it to Google Sheets.

### Iterative Refinement

#### Techniques for refining prompts

Iterative refinement is a crucial technique in prompt engineering that involves continuously improving prompts based on feedback and results. Here are some effective techniques for iterative refinement:

##### **1. Generate Multiple Outputs**

- **Description**: Start by creating several variations of your prompt to explore different angles and perspectives.
- **Example**: If you're asking for a summary, try different ways of phrasing the request to see which yields the best results.

##### **2. Evaluate and Select**

- **Description**: After generating multiple outputs, evaluate them based on clarity, relevance, and coherence. Select the best-performing prompts for further refinement.
- **Example**: Compare the outputs to see which one best meets your criteria and refine that prompt further.

##### **3. Gradual Expansion**

- **Description**: Begin with a concise initial prompt that covers the core ideas. Gradually add more details and context to improve the quality of the responses.
- **Example**: Start with "Summarize the article" and expand to "Summarize the article, focusing on the main arguments and supporting evidence."

##### **4. Incorporate Feedback**

- **Description**: Use feedback from the model's responses to refine the prompt. Identify areas where the model's output was unclear or off-target and adjust the prompt accordingly.
- **Example**: If the model's response is too vague, add more specific instructions or examples to guide it.

##### **5. Use Step-by-Step Instructions**

- **Description**: Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps. This helps the model follow a clear logical sequence.
- **Example**: Instead of asking for a complete analysis, ask for a step-by-step breakdown of the analysis process.

##### **6. Contextual Prompts**

- **Description**: Provide additional context to help the model understand the task better. This can include background information, examples, or specific details.
- **Example**: "Given the recent advancements in AI, summarize the key points of the article on AI ethics."

##### **7. Experiment with Different Structures**

- **Description**: Try different prompt structures to see which one works best. This can include changing the order of information, using different formats, or varying the level of detail.
- **Example**: Experiment with prompts like "List the main points" versus "Describe the main points in detail."

##### **8. Monitor and Iterate**

- **Description**: Continuously monitor the performance of your prompts and iterate based on the results. Keep refining until you achieve the desired output quality.
- **Example**: Regularly review the outputs and make incremental adjustments to improve accuracy and relevance.

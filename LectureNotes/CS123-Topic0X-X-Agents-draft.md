[TOC]

AI agents are software programs that use artificial intelligence to perform tasks autonomously. They can learn from data, make decisions, and interact with their environment to achieve specific goals. Here are a few types of AI agents:

1. **Reactive Agents**: These agents respond to specific stimuli from their environment without using past experiences. They are simple and fast but lack the ability to learn or adapt.

2. **Model-Based Agents**: These agents maintain an internal model of the world and use it to make decisions. They can plan and predict future states based on their actions.

3. **Goal-Based Agents**: These agents have specific goals and use strategies to achieve them. They can evaluate different actions based on how well they help achieve the goal.

4. **Utility-Based Agents**: These agents aim to maximize a utility function, which measures the desirability of different outcomes. They can make trade-offs between different goals to achieve the best overall result.

5. **Learning Agents**: These agents can improve their performance over time by learning from their experiences. They use techniques like machine learning to adapt to new situations and improve their decision-making.

AI agents are used in various applications, from virtual assistants and chatbots to autonomous vehicles and recommendation systems. They help automate tasks, provide personalized experiences, and make complex decisions more efficiently.

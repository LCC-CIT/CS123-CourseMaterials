## Project 3: Prompt Engineering

Each member of each team will design a prompt for a specific task in the career area that your team is focused on. Your prompt should use all the best practices discussed in class and use a few-shot or a  chain-of-thought strategy. It should be a fairly detailed and in-depth  prompt.

Discuss the tasks that you will write prompts for on  [Discord](https://classes.lanecc.edu/mod/url/view.php?id=4656317) so that each of you are focusing on a different task. Each team member can post a draft of their prompt and get feedback from other team members.

## Additions for next time

- List your team and include a copy of discussion with team.
- Describe approach (few-shot, chain-of-thought, role, etc.)

- Include response and say which model was used.
- Give an evaluation of the quality and explain how you evaluated.
